-- | This plugin system allows access to the database to be extended by running one or more
-- actions on a block insert or rollback.
--
-- The insert and rollback actions are applied from the head of the list to the tail.
-- The default SyncNodePlugin is 'defDbSyncNodePlugin'. This
-- allows clients to insert db actions both before and after the default action.

-- Plugins are free to read from the existing tables but should not modify them. Plugins however
-- are free to operation on their own tables.

-- Usually, insert plugins would be added after the default (so that the default action happens
-- first, and then the added ones) whereas for rollback plugins, the rollback actions would
-- normally happen *before* the default rollback.
-- That is why the following data type does not have a Semigroup/Monoid instances.

-- TODO(KS): If required, we can unfiy the plugin system to be sequence based, rather then list based.
-- We can switch the types to be like the `plugInsertBlock`, not lists.
